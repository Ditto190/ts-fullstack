# Behavior Taxonomy - Lightweight Reference for Agents
# This is NOT a registry of behaviors - it's a taxonomy reference
# Actual behaviors are tracked via @behavior headers in code
# The registry (behaviors.json) is auto-generated from code

# Operations
operations:
  # Standard CRUD
  CREATE: "Create new entity"
  READ: "Retrieve entity"
  UPDATE: "Modify existing entity"
  DELETE: "Remove entity"
  LIST: "Query multiple entities"

  # Development operations
  IMPLEMENT: "Implement functionality"
  TEST: "Test functionality"
  VALIDATE: "Validate implementation"
  DOCUMENT: "Document functionality"

  # Build operations
  COMPILE: "Compile TypeScript"
  BUNDLE: "Bundle assets"
  OPTIMIZE: "Optimize build output"
  CACHE: "Cache build artifacts"

  # Deployment operations
  DEPLOY: "Deploy to environment"
  MIGRATE: "Run database migrations"
  CONFIGURE: "Configure environment"
  MONITOR: "Monitor system health"

  # Code quality operations
  LINT: "Lint code"
  FORMAT: "Format code"
  TYPECHECK: "Type check"
  ANALYZE: "Analyze code quality"

# Status lifecycle
status_lifecycle:
  - PLANNED        # Identified, not started
  - IN_PROGRESS    # Currently being implemented
  - DONE           # Implemented and tested
  - BLOCKED        # Blocked by dependency
  - DEPRECATED     # No longer needed

# Priority levels
priorities:
  CRITICAL: "Template cannot function without this"
  HIGH: "Essential for production readiness"
  MEDIUM: "Enhances development experience"
  LOW: "Nice to have, future enhancement"

# Effort estimates (Agentic Time)
# Agents operate 10-100x faster than humans
# These estimates assume agent has proper context and tools
efforts:
  TRIVIAL: "< 5 minutes (simple CRUD, obvious patterns)"
  SMALL: "5-30 minutes (standard Behavior, clear requirements)"
  MEDIUM: "30 minutes - 2 hours (moderate complexity, some discovery needed)"
  LARGE: "2-4 hours (complex integration, multiple components)"
  XLARGE: "> 4 hours (significant architecture, unclear requirements, needs human collaboration)"

# Note on XLARGE: If estimate exceeds 4 hours, break down into smaller behaviors
